## Mission & Vision

Project CREDIBLE is a research-practice partnership intended to advance how middle and high schoolers use data in science classes. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the project involves a collaboration between teachers, researchers, and two partner organizations—the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont and DataClassroom.

This project will empower teachers and their students to make sense of data within and beyond classroom contexts, sharing research findings, an educational technology tool for Bayesian data analysis, and curricular resources in open and accessible ways.

### Our Approach

There are four core aspects of our collaboration:

1. **The Data Investigation Cycle** — Posing questions, considering and gathering data, processing data, exploring and visualizing data, considering models, and communicating conclusions and proposing action

2. **Place-Based Education** — Drawing on the places and spaces in which we and our students live and teach as assets for science teaching and learning

3. **Thinking Probabilistically** — Considering the aspects of the data investigation cycle not in terms of whether the data is "right" or "wrong," but through probabilistic reasoning

4. **Ambitious Science Teaching** — Using an approach to science teaching and learning that is oriented toward students' engagement with big ideas, sharing their initial conceptions, and making progress toward refining and sharing their understanding throughout various aspects of a lesson sequence

The original proposal for the project is available [here](https://osf.io/wn9mx/).

## FAQs

### What is Project CREDIBLE?

Project CREDIBLE (Creatively Reimagining Engagement With Data in Biology Learning Environments) is a National Science Foundation-funded research-practice partnership that advances how middle and high school students use data in science classes. The project brings together teachers, researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, and DataClassroom.

### Who can participate in Project CREDIBLE?

We work with middle and high school science teachers who are interested in integrating data-rich, place-based learning experiences into their classrooms. Teachers participate in professional development, including a retreat at Tremont, and implement lessons throughout the school year.

### What makes this approach different?

Project CREDIBLE emphasizes four key elements: the data investigation cycle, place-based education, probabilistic thinking (rather than deterministic "right or wrong" approaches), and Ambitious Science Teaching methods. We also use specially designed tools like the Confidence Updater to help students think about uncertainty in data.

### Is there funding for participating teachers?

Yes. Participating teachers receive stipends for their time and expertise in the project.

### What is Bayesian data analysis, and why is it important for students?

Bayesian data analysis is an approach that allows students to express their initial ideas or beliefs about a phenomenon and then update those ideas quantitatively based on data they collect or access. This method helps students understand that science involves uncertainty and that data helps us refine our understanding rather than simply proving something "right" or "wrong."
