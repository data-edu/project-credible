    "text": "Partners\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont\nThe Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont is an experiential and outdoor education center located in the nation’s most biodiverse national park. Tremont provides essential place-based learning experiences for Project CREDIBLE participants.\nJohn DiDiego Education Director\nJohn DiDiego grew up catching snakes and turtles in the creeks of upstate South Carolina and has never lost his love for wild things and places. He holds a bachelor’s degree in English literature from the University of Notre Dame and a master’s degree in natural resources from the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point.\nWith more than 25 years of experience in environmental education, DiDiego has worked in settings from New England and Yosemite National Park to the country of Georgia and far eastern Russia. Still, there’s no place he’d rather be than the southern Appalachians. He enjoys hiking, biking, kayaking, turning over logs, and playing and singing folk music.\nAnnie Roth Manager of the Teacher Network\nAnnie Roth has felt a deep connection to the land since childhood. Growing up in Michigan and spending weekends at her family’s cabin “up north,” she waded through the Little Manistee River catching fish, finding frogs, and getting messy. That early curiosity sparked a lifelong connection to the natural world and a passion for sharing it with others.\nShe earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Grand Valley State University before moving to Nashville, where she taught and led project-based learning initiatives in schools across the city. She later earned a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction from Middle Tennessee State University.\nAt Tremont, Annie bridges her two greatest loves—teaching and the outdoors—by helping people connect with nature. In her free time, she enjoys discovering new fungi, hiking backcountry trails with her husband and their dog, Maple, fly fishing, and exploring Tennessee’s waters by kayak or paddleboard.\n\n\nDataClassroom\nDataClassroom provides the statistical software tools that make Bayesian data analysis more accessible for high school learners.\nAaron Reedy Cofounder & CEO\nAaron Reedy co-founded the platform to help students and teachers visualize and analyze data in the classroom. He previously served as a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Auburn University, where he worked with Tonia Schwartz to study sex differences in aging in brown anole lizards.\nHe earned his Ph.D. in biology from the University of Virginia, where he was the James and Elizabeth Wright Jefferson Fellow. Before pursuing graduate studies, Reedy taught biology and zoology in a Chicago public high school, an experience that continues to inform his commitment to making science accessible and engaging for students.\nDan Temple Cofounder & CTO\nBefore cofounding the platform, Dan Temple spent his career in the electronics and semiconductor industries, working with companies ranging from small startups to multinational corporations, including Sony and Intel.\nMotivated by the lack of effective data tools available to his children in school, Temple teamed up with Aaron Reedy to launch DataClassroom. He now brings his expertise in building user-friendly systems and managing technical teams to develop accessible, high-quality data analysis tools for students and educators. He earned a degree in electronic engineering from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom."

    "text": "FAQs\n\nWhat is Project CREDIBLE?\nProject CREDIBLE (Creatively Reimagining Engagement With Data in Biology Learning Environments) is a National Science Foundation-funded research-practice partnership that advances how middle and high school students use data in science classes. The project brings together teachers, researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, and DataClassroom.\n\n\nWho can participate in Project CREDIBLE?\nWe work with middle and high school science teachers who are interested in integrating data-rich, place-based learning experiences into their classrooms. Teachers participate in professional development, including a retreat at Tremont, and implement lessons throughout the school year.\n\n\nWhat makes this approach different?\nProject CREDIBLE emphasizes four key elements: the data investigation cycle, place-based education, probabilistic thinking (rather than deterministic “right or wrong” approaches), and Ambitious Science Teaching methods. We also use specially designed tools like the Confidence Updater to help students think about uncertainty in data.\n\n\nIs there funding for participating teachers?\nYes. Participating teachers receive stipends for their time and expertise in the project.\n\n\nWhat is Bayesian data analysis, and why is it important for students?\nBayesian data analysis is an approach that allows students to express their initial ideas or beliefs about a phenomenon and then update those ideas quantitatively based on data they collect or access. This method helps students understand that science involves uncertainty and that data helps us refine our understanding rather than simply proving something “right” or “wrong.”\n\n\nHow can I get involved?\nVisit our Get Involved page to learn about opportunities for teachers to participate in upcoming cohorts, or contact us with questions.\n\n\nWhat resources are available?\nWe offer curriculum resources, including the ABCs of Data framework, the Confidence Updater web application, and various teaching materials. Visit our Educator Network section to access these resources."

She teaches in the International Baccalaureate program at West High School, where she specializes in Environmental Systems and Societies, a course that explores the connections between human and natural systems, from soil and water to the atmosphere. Her students venture into real-world topics such as eutrophication, agriculture and cattle production, and climate change.\nHensley’s love for the outdoors began in childhood, as she explored her family’s 11-acre homestead in Michigan. Her father taught her to observe, ask questions, and seek answers—an approach she brings to her classroom. She holds a degree in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where she studied under Taylor Feild, a professor who inspired her by always responding to her answers with more questions. Most often, “Why?” She strives to encourage her students to question and wonder, as both her father and professor did for her.\nAt West High School, Hensley currently collaborates with Ijams Nature Center on the first annual data collection for the IB Collaborative Science Project, a capstone experience for her 11th-grade students."
