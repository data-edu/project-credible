<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mission-vision">Mission &amp; Vision</h2>
<p>Project CREDIBLE is a research-practice partnership intended to advance how middle and high schoolers use data in science classes. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the project involves a collaboration between teachers, researchers, and two partner organizations—the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont and DataClassroom.</p>
<p>This project will empower teachers and their students to make sense of data within and beyond classroom contexts, sharing research findings, an educational technology tool for Bayesian data analysis, and curricular resources in open and accessible ways.</p>
<section id="our-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-approach">Our Approach</h3>
<p>There are four core aspects of our collaboration:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Data Investigation Cycle</strong> — Posing questions, considering and gathering data, processing data, exploring and visualizing data, considering models, and communicating conclusions and proposing action</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Place-Based Education</strong> — Drawing on the places and spaces in which we and our students live and teach as assets for science teaching and learning</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thinking Probabilistically</strong> — Considering the aspects of the data investigation cycle not in terms of whether the data is “right” or “wrong,” but through probabilistic reasoning</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ambitious Science Teaching</strong> — Using an approach to science teaching and learning that is oriented toward students’ engagement with big ideas, sharing their initial conceptions, and making progress toward refining and sharing their understanding throughout various aspects of a lesson sequence</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The original proposal for the project is available <a href="https://osf.io/wn9mx/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>John DiDiego</strong> <em>Education Director</em></p>
<p>John DiDiego grew up catching snakes and turtles in the creeks of upstate South Carolina and has never lost his love for wild things and places. He holds a bachelor’s degree in English literature from the University of Notre Dame and a master’s degree in natural resources from the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point.</p>
<p>With more than 25 years of experience in environmental education, DiDiego has worked in settings from New England and Yosemite National Park to the country of Georgia and far eastern Russia. Still, there’s no place he’d rather be than the southern Appalachians. He enjoys hiking, biking, kayaking, turning over logs, and playing and singing folk music.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Roth</strong> <em>Manager of the Teacher Network</em></p>
<p>Annie Roth has felt a deep connection to the land since childhood. Growing up in Michigan and spending weekends at her family’s cabin “up north,” she waded through the Little Manistee River catching fish, finding frogs, and getting messy. That early curiosity sparked a lifelong connection to the natural world and a passion for sharing it with others.</p>
<p>She earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Grand Valley State University before moving to Nashville, where she taught and led project-based learning initiatives in schools across the city. She later earned a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction from Middle Tennessee State University.</p>
<p>At Tremont, Annie bridges her two greatest loves—teaching and the outdoors—by helping people connect with nature. In her free time, she enjoys discovering new fungi, hiking backcountry trails with her husband and their dog, Maple, fly fishing, and exploring Tennessee’s waters by kayak or paddleboard.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-can-participate-in-project-credible">Who can participate in Project CREDIBLE?</h3>
<p>We work with middle and high school science teachers who are interested in integrating data-rich, place-based learning experiences into their classrooms. Teachers participate in professional development, including a retreat at Tremont, and implement lessons throughout the school year.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-this-approach-different">What makes this approach different?</h3>
<p>Project CREDIBLE emphasizes four key elements: the data investigation cycle, place-based education, probabilistic thinking (rather than deterministic “right or wrong” approaches), and Ambitious Science Teaching methods. We also use specially designed tools like the Confidence Updater to help students think about uncertainty in data.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-funding-for-participating-teachers">Is there funding for participating teachers?</h3>
<p>Yes. Participating teachers receive stipends for their time and expertise in the project.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-bayesian-data-analysis-and-why-is-it-important-for-students">What is Bayesian data analysis, and why is it important for students?</h3>
<p>Bayesian data analysis is an approach that allows students to express their initial ideas or beliefs about a phenomenon and then update those ideas quantitatively based on data they collect or access. This method helps students understand that science involves uncertainty and that data helps us refine our understanding rather than simply proving something “right” or “wrong.”</p>
