Welcome to the **Project CREDIBLE (Creatively Reimagining Engagement With Data in Biology Learning Environments)** website.

## Our Mission

Project CREDIBLE is a research-practice partnership intended to advance how middle and high school students use data in science classes. Funded by the National Science Foundation, we bring together teachers, researchers at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu/), the [Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont](https://gsmit.org/), and [DataClassroom](https://dataclassroom.com/) to transform data literacy in STEM education.

### Our Approach

We focus on four core aspects:

1. **The Data Investigation Cycle** — From posing questions to communicating conclusions
2. **Place-Based Education** — Using local environments as assets for learning
3. **Thinking Probabilistically** — Moving beyond "right" or "wrong" to embrace uncertainty
4. **Ambitious Science Teaching** — Engaging students with big ideas and their own thinking
